TODO:

1. Add a file that will be contained all rules for each moudle. and when executing updator, updator will read the related moudle's rules and execute each one of the them.
 or - use mongodb instead of a file! 🤗
2. Check david case's - pattern appres in pattern... and so on. 🤗
3. Seperate to appropriate moudles and classes. 🤗
4. Remove unnecessary code - not complete 🙄
5. Fix remove node feature  🤗
6. add more cases to check - as combined use of $n + $all... 🙄
	and cases we wrote on the notebook... as remove params.. and so on
	
7. add test related to 1 - combined rules together.. 🤗

end - 2. Add the command line interface 🙄
end - 1. consider add a structre id to each rule - weather it's a function, attr... and so on
 cause for example - the pattern "moudleName.atrrName" should change somwhow the attrName, but if a function has the same name, it will catch also that.
end. treat a case where the function is import above in a sentence of 'from lib import function'

What's next? list with order
1. Remove unnecessary code from astcompare 🤗
2. Clean code 🤗
3. Move all code src to src dir 🤗
4. Fix preparing pattern functionallty... move to astPattern perhaps?
5. Fix global params defintions in all files in appropiate way,
	 consider creating a const / config file
6. Add more cases to check - as combined use of $n + $all...
	 and cases we wrote on the notebook... as remove params.. and so on
