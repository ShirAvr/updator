TODO:

1. Add a file that will be contained all rules for each moudle. and when executing updator, updator will read the related moudle's rules and execute each one of the them.
 or - use mongodb instead of a file!
2. Check david case's - pattern appres in pattern... and so on.
3. Seperate to appropriate moudles and classes.
4. Remove unnecessary code
5. Fix remove node feature


end - 1. Add the command line interface
end. consider add a structre id to each rule - weather it's a function, attr... and so on
 cause for example - the pattern "moudleName.atrrName" should change somwhow the attrName, but if a function has the same name, it will catch also that.
